This is a web animation project using Anime.js to recreate the Seed.com biome growth animation. The project focuses on:

## Key Technologies
- **Anime.js**: Primary animation library for smooth transitions and complex animations
- **Vite**: Build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS for maximum performance and control
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling with animations and responsive design

## Animation Patterns
- **Sequential frame animations**: Simulating the 100+ frame sequence from Seed.com
- **Particle systems**: Creating organic, biome-like growth patterns
- **Morphing transitions**: Smooth transformations between animation states
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient rendering for complex animations

## Code Style
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Implement modular animation components
- Focus on performance and smooth 60fps animations
- Create responsive designs that work across devices
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup

## Animation Concepts to Implement
- Bacterial/microbial growth patterns
- Organic, flowing movements
- Particle emergence and evolution
- Color transitions and morphing
- Interactive hover and scroll effects
